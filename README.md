# Python Fundamentals!
-------------------
### Commenting in your IDE
You can create comments in your code 
in two ways:<br>
Using `# (This is a comment)`<br>
or <br>
Using `""" (Your comment goes here) """`

### Data Types
There are three main data types in Python: 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br> Th
1) **Numbers** (This is broken down into two subcategories)<br>
   1) **Integers**- which are whole numbers, `eg. 10 or 67` (Use int() to change datatype to integer)<br> 
   2) **Floats**- which handle decimal numbers, `eg. 13.4 or 91.25`<br>
2) **Strings**- characters or text `‚ÜêThat can be string- and so can this!`<br>
3) **Boolean**- representing a value that is either `true` or `false`.<br>

Python will detect the data type of data you have inputted and 'class' them <br>
as the detected type. You can also view what data type python has assigned to your data using the 'type' function. <br>
Here's an example:<br>

### Math Operators
Most programming languages have the same math operators.

Operator:&nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Function:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; |  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Example:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  +  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Add &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10 + 10 (20)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  -  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Subtract&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;|  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 20 - 10 (10)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Multiply&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;|   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10 * 10 (100)<br> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  / &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Divide&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;|  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 100 / 20 (5)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  % &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Modulo&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 20 % 6 (2)<br>

<i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i>
<i class="fas fa-lightbulb" style="color: yellow; font-size: 24px;"></i>
Modulo calculates the remainder of a division operation. So in the example above, 6 goes into 12 twice, and leaves 2 remaining. Thus the example above returns 2.<br>

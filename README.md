# Python Fundamentals!

### Commenting in your IDE
You can create comments in your code 
in two ways:<br>
Using `# (This is a comment)`<br>
or <br>
Using `""" (Your comment goes here) """`

### Data Types
There are three main data types in Python: 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br> Th
1) **Numbers** (This is broken down into two subcategories)<br>
   1) **Integers**- which are whole numbers, `eg. 10 or 67` (Use int() to change datatype to integer)<br> 
   2) **Floats**- which handle decimal numbers, `eg. 13.4 or 91.25`<br>
2) **Strings**- characters or text `←That can be string- and so can this!`<br>
3) **Boolean**- representing a value that is either `true` or `false`.<br>

Python will detect the data type of data you have inputted and 'class' them <br>
as the detected type. You can also view what data type python has assigned to your data using the 'type' function. <br>
Here's an example:<br>

### Math Operators
Most programming languages have the same math operators.

Operator | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;↓ <br>
'+' | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
'-' | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
'*' | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
'/' | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
'%' | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
